jul 10 '13 : added exes and primitive detection btw player and ex, and missile and ex.
exes

jul 11: made exes move columns. started adapting for consecutive levels and lives.  seems to work at moment, though i should do something to make it clear that you've died, or advanced to the next level.

jul 12: levels, endlevel animation pov skews in, firing to 6.  score and lives on display.

jul 14: added two more frames to ex jumping, enabled playability during levelclear sequence, 

jul 15 2013: added spikes and holding level state on death.  added spinners.  added more board levels.


todo next:
add more levels?
  fig8
  broken spiral?

random other thing?  something to collect for extra life?  something that slows down the exes?

add sound.
